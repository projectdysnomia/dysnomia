# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing!

A few rules of thumb:
- Code contributions should match the existing code style. 
    - `npm run lint` to check the formatting
    - `npm run lint:fix` to fix some of the issues
- Discuss additions/changes with us [on Discord](https://discord.gg/2uUvgJzgCE) before working on them
- Check the dev branch to make sure someone hasn't worked on the same thing already
- Pull requests should point to the dev branch.
